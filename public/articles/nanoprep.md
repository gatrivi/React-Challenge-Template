### NaNoWriMo Pocket Handbook - Preparation Guide

#### October 23 - 31: Pre-NaNoWriMo Prep

**Day 1-2: Idea Generation & Outlining**

- **Brainstorm Ideas**: List 3-5 story ideas. Choose the one that excites you the most.
- **Outline (High-Level)**: Decide on your story’s beginning, middle, and end. Use a simple structure like the three-act or hero’s journey.

**Day 3-4: Characters & Setting**

- **Character Sketches**: Write 1-2 sentences for each main character (goals, conflicts, backstory).
- **Setting Overview**: Summarize your main locations in 2-3 sentences. Note key sensory details.

**Day 5: Plot Points**

- **Detailed Plot**: Expand your outline into key scenes or chapters. Jot down what needs to happen at each stage.

**Day 6: Backstory & Subplots**

- **Backstory**: Write 1-2 paragraphs that won’t make it into the book but help ground your story.
- **Subplots**: Identify 1-2 minor subplots to flesh out the story.

**Day 7: Schedule & Word Count Goals**

- **Set Daily Word Goals**: NaNoWriMo requires ~1,667 words/day. Mark days you might write more or less.
- **Create Writing Rituals**: Plan when and where you'll write each day.

**Day 8: Warm-up Writing**

- **Practice**: Write 500-1000 words as a warm-up scene or dialogue to get into the flow.

#### Daily Reminders:

- **Keep it simple**: Don't overcomplicate; NaNoWriMo is about word count.
- **Preparation is flexible**: It’s okay to adjust as new ideas emerge.
