For a pocket-handbook style resource on UX, font colors, and CSS, you can explore a few comprehensive options that provide illustrations and easy-to-understand examples:

1. **Chakra UI**: It’s a highly flexible library for building accessible and responsive interfaces with well-documented components, particularly for React apps. It offers visual consistency, great theming options, and is beginner-friendly once you get past the initial learning curve.
2. **Materialize CSS**: Based on Google’s Material Design guidelines, this framework ensures polished, cohesive, and responsive designs. It's perfect for visually consistent web apps and includes lots of pre-designed UI elements and a responsive grid system.
3. **Bulma CSS**: A lightweight and intuitive framework known for its simplicity and clean design. It’s great for smaller projects like personal portfolios or blogs, thanks to its easy-to-learn grid system and responsive modifiers.
